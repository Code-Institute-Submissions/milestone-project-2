# JM HOLIDAYS

This is my second milestone project through the course provided by codeinstitute.
I was asked to create an application that allows users to search for holidays,
giving information such as, 'tourist attractions', 'hotels & accomodation' and 
'bars and restaurants' that can be found within the area that the user searches for
using the search bar provided. 

I did this by using the documents provided by google maps such as, 'Google Maps API' 
and 'Google Places API'.

## UX

- This site was created with the intention of allowing users to search for a holiday 
destination around the globe. JM HOLIDAYS is typically aimed at the people who can 
afford a holiday, e.g. adults. My project aids users in achieving a booked holiday
as it allows them to search worldwide for: accomodation, points of interest and 
food locations. These combined allows a user to get a strong idea of what each
location is offering, all within a few clicks. 

### User Stories

1: As a user, I wish to have the ability to search for a location as well as 
accomodation, giving me ratings of the accomodation.
I want this as it allows me to search quickly and effectively, saving me time.

2: As a user, I wish to have the ability to search for bars and restaurants 
that I can go to when i travel to Italy. This is so that i can plan my days
in advance, so that i can relax more without having to stress over where
me and the family are going to eat for the evening. 

3: As a user, I wish to have the ability to search for points of interest in China, 
as I plan to move there permanently. I want this feature so that i can make a plan 
of where i am going to go when i arrive in China. 

4: As a user, I wish to be able to see Accomodation reviews, as well as direct links
to the accomodation websites so that i can see more clearly where that accomodation 
is located and how much it would cost. I want this feature so that i can make a more
informed decision on where i will stay when i go on holiday. 

5: As a user, I wish to have the ability to search for Bars and Clubs in my location
so that i can go out and celebrate. I want this feature so that I can quickly search
for multiple locations at once, showing me how far I would have to travel to reach
that bar or club.
