# JM HOLIDAYS

This is my second milestone project through the course provided by Codeinstitute.
I was asked to create an application that allows users to search for holidays,
giving information such as 'tourist attractions', 'hotels & accomodation' and 
'bars and restaurants' that can be found within the area that the user searches for
using the search bar provided. 

I did this by using 'Google Maps API' and 'Google Places API'.

## UX

- This site was created with the intention of allowing users to search for a holiday 
destination around the globe. JM HOLIDAYS is typically aimed at the people who can 
afford a holiday, e.g. adults. My project aids users in achieving a booked holiday
as it allows them to search worldwide for: accomodation, points of interest and 
food locations. These combined allows a user to get a strong idea of what each
location is offering, all within a few clicks. 

### User Stories

1: As a user, I wish to have the ability to search for a location as well as 
accomodation, giving me ratings of the accomodation.
I want this as it allows me to search quickly and effectively, saving me time.

2: As a user, I wish to have the ability to search for bars and restaurants 
that I can go to when i travel to Italy. This is so that i can plan my days
in advance, so that i can relax more without having to stress over where
me and the family are going to eat for the evening. 

3: As a user, I wish to have the ability to search for points of interest in China, 
as I plan to move there permanently. I want this feature so that i can make a plan 
of where i am going to go when i arrive in China. 

4: As a user, I wish to be able to see Accomodation reviews, as well as direct links
to the accomodation websites so that i can see more clearly where that accomodation 
is located and how much it would cost. I want this feature so that i can make a more
informed decision on where i will stay when i go on holiday. 

5: As a user, I wish to have the ability to search for Bars and Clubs in my location
so that i can go out and celebrate. I want this feature so that I can quickly search
for multiple locations at once, showing me how far I would have to travel to reach
that bar or club. 

#### Mockups

All of my mockups are located in this repository in the mockups directory.

## Features

#### MAP

- Allows user to see the map of the world, giving them the opportunity to search
the world for destinations to travel to.

#### dropdown

- Allows user to select which search results they wish to see, giving them more
control over what the user wishes to see at what time. 
1: restaurants
2: hotels
3: points of interest

### searchbox

- Allows user to search for specific locations around the world, which makes finding
a location to go on holiday much quicker; created for the users convenience.

### social media links in footer

- Allows users to have social media links so that they can follow JM holidays
should they wish to. However as this is a project for Codeinstitute, the social
media links are dummy links and go no where. 

### future features

- my plans for the future are:

1: to add more custom markers for users
2: add a calendar that links to the map so that users can select a date to go as
well as a location.
3: add the possibility to save locations so that users can return at a later date.


## Technologies used

##### Bootstrap
(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
- I used bootstrap so that I can use the grid system to allow me to place everything
on my page neatly.

##### Font Awesome
(https://origin.fontawesome.com/)

- i used fontawesome to allow me to add social media links to the footer of my page.


##### Google map API
(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/)

- I Used google map API to allow me to complete this project, it gave me access to a
map as well as lots of features to add to the map.

##### Google places API
(https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)

- I used Google places API to allow me to add features such as the search result
function; adding hotels and restaurants.

##### Balsamiq

## Testing

I tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools, testing its 
functionality as well as the look and feel (in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy 
S5, Nexus 5S, Nexus 6P, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X,
iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop.
I tested the functionality of the reset button. I also tested the 'Enter a city' 
input box with wrong names and empty strings to ensure they don't break the site. 

## Deployment
- i have successfully deployed my website, which is hosted on github.
  the deployed version and the local versions are the same. 
 The site can be found here : (https://jakematthews1234.github.io/milestone-project-2/)
